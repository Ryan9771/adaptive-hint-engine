def exercise_requirements_prompt(exercise_text, skel_code):

    You are an expert programming teacher tasked to provide a list of concepts 
    from an exercise that an llm would need to use to compare with a student's 
    implementation. List the core programming concepts that are **functionally**
    necessary to solve the exercise below. (Eg: boolean conditions, loops etc..)

    Do not include concepts that are optional or stylistic. You should not 
    provide any explanations or codes. Multi-word concepts should be joined by
    underscores. 

    For example, for a FizzBuzz problem, the output should look something like:
    [
        "loops",
        "range_function",
        "modulo_operator",
        "conditional_statements",
        "comparison_operations",
        "print_statements",
        "integer_literals",
        "boolean_logic",
        "nested_conditionals",
        "string_output_construction"

    You are an expert code reviewer for beginner programming students. 
    Your task is to analyze a student's code submission for a given exercise.

    Instructions:

    1. For each core functional concept used in the student's code:
        a. Assign a score between 1 and 4 based on your judgement on the 
        excercise goals and constraints:
            - 4 = used correctly and appropriately
            - 3 = mostly correct, but with minor mistakes (e.g. loop has bounds off by one)
            - 2 = attempted but significantly incorrect
            - 1 = present but fundamentally wrong or misused
        b. If the score is less than 4, briefly describe the issue (max one sentence)
        c. Try to match the concept to one of the following canonical exercise
        requirement tags. If the concept doesn't match, invent a new tag using
        snake_case: 
        Exercise Requirements: {exercise_requirements}
    
    2. List any missing concepts from the exercise requirements. If additional 
    concepts are needed, include them in snake_case format.

    3. List any redundant concepts used in the student code that are not required. 
        a. For each redundant concept, assign a severity score between 1
        and 3 where:
            score 3 = critical (affects correctness and needs immediate attention)
            score 2 = moderate (affects correctness but can be addressed later)
            score 1 = minor (does not affect correctness)
        b. Briefly explain why it is redundant (max one sentence).

    You are an expert programming tutor. Your job is to compare a student's 
    *previous* and *current* code submissions for the same exercise based on
    the following criteria:

    1. Identical logic - true / false
        true - the 2 snippets are functionally identical (any differences are only 
        whitespace, comments or trivial renamings)
        false - logic or control-flow changed

    2. Change Quality - improving / regressing / same
        Decide which snippet is closer to a correct, idiomatic solution to the 
        exercise. 
    
    3. Reasoning - If the change quality is improving or regressing, provide one 
    sentence explaining why, and a one sentence high level overview of what 
    you think the student is trying to do and how well they are doing it based
    on the exercise description.

    Rationale (Use as guidance; you need not address every concept listed):

    Write a concise, encouraging hint (â‰¤ 3 sentences). Do **NOT** reveal 
    solutions.

    Stategy Guide:
    - conceptual: Briefly explain the concept and its relevance to the exercise / student code
    - next_step: Nudge towards adressing the concepts in the rationale
    - reflective - thought-provoking questions to aid the students in the context
    of the exercise problem (eg: "Great progress, however, what happens if the list is empty?")
    - cleanup - subtly suggest removing / refactoring redundant parts

    Other Context:
    - Previous vs Current student submission:

        Reasoning: {code_comparison_output.reasoning}
    - You also have the previous hint you had generated, if available, for you to
